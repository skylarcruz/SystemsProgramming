ok is a program in c which takes a single argument, a word.
Program uses a dictionary with a fixed length per line, default dictionary
is of line length 16. Given an argument word, it will search the dictionary
for an instance of the argument word. If it exists, it will print "yes" to
stdout, otherwise it will print no.

Dictionary is defined after the include statements. Program includes error checking
for accessing the dictionary file.

Wordlength is defined as well, allowing dictionaries of different lengths.
